# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ryan, a former bartender turned full-stack developer.

## Organizations

### [Tech-Elevator](https://github.com/Tech-Elevator)

Here, you'll find a collection of coding projects that I completed during my time at the coding bootcamp Tech Elevator. These repositories showcase my journey through the program and the skills I honed along the way.

### [Odin Project](https://github.com/Odin-Project)

In this organization, you'll discover projects I worked on while mastering my coding skills through The Odin Project. The projects are named according to The Odin Project course that they occurred in and the name of the project within that course (for example: Foundations.EtchASketch relates to the Etch-A-Sketch assignment in the Foundations course).

### [Personal Projects](https://github.com/Your-Personal-Projects)

This container holds a variety of personal coding ventures and experiments. I use this space to explore new ideas, improve my abilities, and have fun while coding!

## About My GitHub Account

I'm continuously learning and growing as a developer, and GitHub is where I document my progress and share my work with the world. If any of my projects catch your eye or you'd like to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out.
